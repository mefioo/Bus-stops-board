As I was allowed to use React to accomplish the task, I copied the dependencies provided in the repository. I used Vite as a default build tool and added the libraries required by UTs to properly test my components (@testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event). Any other were automatically installed by Vite.
To make the navigation work I simply used react-router as a subsittute of vue-router.
